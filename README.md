Empty 
In this code snippet, we first open the input CSV file and create a reader object. We also open an output CSV file and create a writer object. We then loop through each row in the CSV file and check if each cell is blank. If a cell is blank, we add the value 'N/A' to it. Finally, we write the updated row to the output CSV file.

Update
In this code snippet, we first open the input CSV file and create a reader object. We also open an output CSV file and create a writer object. We then loop through each row in the CSV file and check if each cell is equal to the value to be replaced. If a cell is equal to the value to be replaced, we replace it with the new value. Finally, we write the updated row to the output CSV file.

Note that you should replace 'old_value' and 'new_value' with the actual values you want to search for and replace with, respectively.
